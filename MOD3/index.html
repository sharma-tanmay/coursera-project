  <div class="section"><h2 class="xyz">Milk</h2>
    <p>Milk is a white, nutrient-rich liquid food produced in the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who are breastfed) before they are able to digest other types of food.[1] Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. .</p></div></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <div class="section"><h2 class="xyz">Protein</h2>
      <p>Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body.[1] They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much energy density as carbohydrates: 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram; in contrast, lipids provide 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition.</p></div></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
    <div class="section"><h2 class="xyz">Broccoli</h2>
      <p>Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large flowering head and stalk is eaten as a vegetable. The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means "the flowering crest of a cabbage", and is the diminutive form of brocco, meaning "small nail" or "sprout".</p></div></div>
